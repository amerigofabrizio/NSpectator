- install ruby 1.9.3 (32 bit.. make sure to add it to the PATH), yes 1.9.3, 2.0+ won't work with nokogiri/native compilation
- run `devkit.exe` (extract to c:\DevKit)
- from c:\DevKit run `ruby dk.rb init`
- then run `ruby dk.rb install`
- then run `gem install json --platform=ruby` to make sure native compliations work
